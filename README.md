# SchoolAppProcessor

A Python/Tkinter application template for school data processing.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. (Optional) Set up Google Sheets API credentials if you plan to use gspread (see https://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2.html).

## Usage
Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Notes
- Tkinter comes with Python by default.
- No local storage is used by default; you can extend the app to use Google Sheets or other cloud backends.
